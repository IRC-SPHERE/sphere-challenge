# Annotation

A team of 12 annotators were recruited and trained to annotate the set of activities outined in the introduction. To support the annotation process, a head mounted camera (Panasonic HX-A500E-K 4K Wearable Action Camera Camcorder) recorded 4K video at 25 FPS to an SD-card. This data is not shared in this dataset, and is used only to assist the annotators. Synchronisation between the NTP clock and the head-mounted camera was achieved by focusing the camera on an NTP-synchronised digital clock at the beginning and end of the recording sequences. 

An annotation tool called ELAN[1] was used for annotation. ELAN is a tool for the creation of complex annotations on video and audio resources, developed by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. 

Room occupancy labels are also given in the training sequences. While perfor- mance evaluation is not directly affected by room prediction on this, participants may find that modelling room occupancy may be informative for prediction of posture and ambulation.

## Challenge hosted by drivendata.org

We are delighted to announce that the SPHERE Challenge, which takes place in conjunction with ECML-PKDD 2016, is now hosted at DrivenData. All challenge features (including the leaderboard, forum, and user/team registration) are now managed at the drivendata website.
