# SPHERE Challenge: Activity Recognition with Multimodal Sensor Data <a name="#introduction"></a>

Obesity, depression, stroke, falls, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal
disease are some of the biggest health issues and fastest-rising categories
of health-care costs. The financial expenditure associated with these is
widely regarded as unsustainable and the impact on quality of life is felt
by millions of people in the UK each day. Smart technologies can
unobtrusively quantify activities of daily living, and these can provide
long-term behavioural patterns that are objective, insightful measures for
clinical professionals and caregivers.

To this end the EPSRC-funded "Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential
Environment (SPHERE)" Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) has
designed a multi-modal sensor system driven by data analytics requirements.
The system is under test in a single house, and will be deployed in a
general population of 100 homes in Bristol (UK). The data sets collected
will be made available to researchers in a variety of communities.

Data is collected from the following three sensing modalities:

- wrist-worn accelerometer;
- RGB-D cameras (i.e. video with depth information); and
- passive environmental sensors.

With these sensor data, we can learn patterns of behaviour, and can track
the deterioration/progress of persons that suffer or recover from various
medical conditions. To achieve this, we focus activity recognition over
multiple tiers, with the two main prediction tasks of SPHERE including:

1. Prediction of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (e.g. tasks such as meal
   preparation, watching television); and
2. Prediction of posture/ambulation (e.g. walking, sitting, transitioning).

Reliable predictions of ADL allows us to model behaviour and of residents
over time, e.g. what does a typical day consist of, what times are
particular activities performed etc. Prediction of posture and ambulation
will complement ADL predictions, and can inform us about the physical
well-being of the participant, how mobile/responsive is the participant,
how active/sedentary, etc.
