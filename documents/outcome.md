# Sphere challenge outcome 

The SPHERE Challenge has Ended!

SPHERE would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants of the challenge, drivendata.org and the AARP foundation for their participation and interest in this competition.

A prize was given to the overall winners of the challenge, and the leaderboard of this is given [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/42/senior-data-science-safe-aging-with-sphere/leaderboard/). 

For the participants that attended the ECML-PKDD discovery challenge, a further prize was awarded to the winning submission. A representative of the winners ('MSUHPDM') is shown in the photograph below receiving the winning certificate.
